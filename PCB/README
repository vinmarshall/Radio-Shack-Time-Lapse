The files in this directory pertain to the printed circuit board design.

The .sch and .pcb files are in the ExpressPCB file format.  You can also purchase
a board from me (vlm@2552.com).

Even if you don't choose to have your board professionally made, the mechanical
drawings, pictures of component placement, and the PDFs of the board layers
are in this directory.
